This basic website allows users to input an image, and returns a page showing both the original and a greyscale version.

In order to run it locally, do the following:

Clone the repository ('git clone https://github.com/JamesOConnor/Basic_Django_site.git')

Cd to the top level where manage.py lives ('cd basic_site')

Run the server ('python manage.py runserver')

You should then be able to navigate to the localhost url and do the operation.
